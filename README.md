# TickTack - an open-source Pomodoro Timer

I'm a 13 year old tech-enthusiast experimenting with SwiftUI. Here is what this app could be:

### Future Features

1. Focus timer with ajustable focus/break sessions
2. App and website blocking, for productivity's sake
3. To-do list synced with Apple Reminders
4. Isolation Mode - set a period of time where all un-selected apps are turned off (iPad and Mac)
5. Controls in the menu bar (Mac only)

Excuse me for my coding skills, beware of desieses if going through my code.
